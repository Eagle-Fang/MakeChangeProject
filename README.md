### Make Change Project

#### In the cash register, we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

#### Lessons Learned - The program was not working when i tried to calculate the number of pennies using this while loop [while (changeCalc - .01 >= 0 )].  Instead, I had to change the while loop to the following statement: [while (changeCalc - .009 >= 0.00 )]
